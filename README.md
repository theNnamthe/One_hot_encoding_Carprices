# One_hot_encoding_Carprices
 Using one hot encoding labelling and dummy variables to predict carprices

First plot data points on a scatter plot chart to see if linear regression model can be applied. If yes, then build a model that can answer following questions,

1) Predict price of a mercedez benz that is 4 yr old with mileage 45000

2) Predict price of a BMW X5 that is 7 yr old with mileage 86000

3) Check score (accuracy) of your model using LinearRegression().score()
